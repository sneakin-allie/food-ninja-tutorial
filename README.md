Tailwind CSS Practice

After reading the Tailwind CSS documentation and playing with some examples, I wanted to create a webpage to put it all together. I watched The Net Ninja's Tailwind tutorials on YouTube and created a simple recipe webpage along with him. Building this page allowed me to practice:

1. Intro & Setup
2. HTML Template
3. Fonts & Colors
4. Margin, Padding & Borders
5. Tailwind config
6. Custom Fonts
7. Using Flexbox
8. Responsive Classes
9. Cards
10. Badges
11. @apply directive
12. Grids
13. Buttons
14. Icons
15. Hover Effects
16. Responsive Navigation
17. Transitions

It was built using Visual Studio Code, Tailwind CSS, HTML, and icons from heroicons.
